This application can be used to connect student in tertiary institution and provide  cognitive capabilities using IBM Watson Conversation services in IBM Cloud.
The University of Bristol is a highly diversified environment as the students were admitted from over 130 different countries in the world to seek knowledge.  The students need a lot to information categories that cut across the different cultures, food, restaurants, clothing during the winter, student accommodation, private accommodation, allergies etc. This informed my decision to create a simple knowledge repository that can be accessed via the smart phones. The knowledge will be learned continuous update of the training data to create the tree model   for automatic response when the user interrogate for any information cutting across the following: different cultures, food, restaurants, clothing during the winter, student accommodation, private accommodation, allergies etc.  The list is not exhaustive, more  information categories can be added to the training data.


A mobile app that runs on Android and iOS with service side layer hosted on AWS or BlueMix. The application will be accessed the API for getting student information after successful registration and the respective Faculty. The serviced will have some dashboards for monitoring activities and reports on usage of the mobile services. The server side layer will be based on Watson Conversation service, a cognitive chatting services that allows information to be put on the 
IBM BlueMix platform as a service (PaaS) solution.  The IBM BlueMix has RESTFUL services that can be invoked and consumed over the Internet to provide response to requests. 

The deliverables of the project are:
1. Android Mobile Chatting app
2. Server side webservices that orchestrate the UoB studentsâ€™ information when the student ID is supplied after successful registration
3. Server side web platform for reports hosted on IBM BlueMix
4. Watson Conversation service with information on the following: cultures, food, restaurants, and clothing during the winter, student accommodation, and private accommodation. 

The mobile application will be hosted on Google play, students can download the mobile app, register and start chatting with the application to get information on the few listed areas mentioned.  The server side webservices will be hosted on IBM BlueMix services   because of the  extensive cognitive services already available on IBM BlueMix. The dashboard will make use of the NoSQL   databases like the cloudant  to store the data for the reports.
